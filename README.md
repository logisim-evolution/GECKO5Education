# GECKO5Education

The Gecko5Education is a new take on an open hardware educational platform. The ideas
of the Gecko5Education are based on the open hardware [ULX3S](https://github.com/emard/ulx3s) board,
the [Gecko4Education](https://gecko-wiki.ti.bfh.ch/) line of boards, and the recently developed 
[Leguan development board](https://leguan.ti.bfh.ch/).

This is a small (60.6x100 mm) standalone FPGA board 
for education, research and general purpose. It's open source and 
open hardware. It continues my line of educational boards used in the
past for teaching and research projects.

# Production
The prototypes for these boards were produced and mounted by [Eurocircuits](https://www.eurocircuits.com/).

# Financement
The prototypes for these board (V1.0 and V1.1) were financed by the [computer architecture lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lap/) of [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch). Version V1.2 and the CPU-addon was financed by the [HuCE-microlab](https://www.bfh.ch/ti/de/forschung/forschungsbereiche/microlab/) Prof. Dr. Theo Kluter.
